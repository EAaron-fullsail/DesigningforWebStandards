              As a nation we endured one of the most horrific terrorist attacks, since 9/11, on the morning of April 15, 2013 at the annual Boston Marathon. A small group of terrorists carried out a plot that killed 3 people, and wounded hundreds more.  It has since been determined that the attack, which took place at the finish line of the Marathon, was carried out by two brothers : Dzhokhar & Tamerlan Tsarnaev
              </p>

              <p>
              The first Element of Digital citizenship states that we should all be 

                 <p class="quote">“Working toward equal digital rights and supporting electronic access is the starting point of Digital Citizenship.”<br/> <a href=
              "http://digitalcitizenship.net/Nine_Elements.html">Link to Article</a></p> </p>

              However it was access to the internet which allowed for the Tsarnaev brothers to find information leading to the construction of  makeshift explosive devices which were used in the attack. It was reported that the alleged bombers learned how to make a bomb out of a pressure cooker by reading plans for a similar device online.
              </p>

              <p class="quote">“Speaking to the FBI from his hospital bed in Boston, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has also reportedly confessed that he and his brother Tamerlan planted the pressure cooker bombs, and were driven to commit the attack by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.”<br/> <a href=
              "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313782/Dzhokhar-Tsarnaev-Boston-Marathon-bomber-admits-learned-build-bomb-Inspire-magazine.html">Link to Article</a></p>

              <p>When we think about Digital Access we hardly consider the possibility of someone using the internet in order to learn something with the intention of hurting others. This just goes to show that there are still people who do not know or respect the Nine Elements that lead to being an effective Digital Citizen. There are still people posting, and reading information that is unlawful, untrue, or meant to be used with the intent of harming others. . </p>

              <p>
              The true purpose of the internet is to make all information free and available to anyone who has a connection. However, when does our government have the right to block information in order to protect the citizens of the United States? Would this attack ever happened if the  the plans, for the makeshift explosives that made the bombing possible, never existed online? It is this kind of content, uploaded by people with poor digital etiquette, that can lead to harming someone’s health and well being.  </p>

               Millions of people played a part in what information was being released during the investigation for the two suspects, and most of that information was coming straight from the cellphones owned by residents from boston. This information was loaded into popular social media sites which only <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/the-boston-bombing-how-journalists-used-twitter-to-tell-the-story">seconds</a> after the bombing took place.   Instantaneously everyone in the Boston, with a cellphone or computer, became a citizen journalist. Many news stations, and Authorities claimed that this interfered with the investigation and manhunt. 
              </p>


              <p class="quote">“citizens spent collective hours analyzing the footage on their own, with their own suspicions, and using sites that aggregate data like reddit.com to scrutinize details. While these citizen researchers were helping, it can also create a lot of problems and a larger danger for misinformation.” <br/><a href=
              "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-medias-role-in-boston-bombing-investigation/">Link to Article</a></p>

              <p>Photos of the bombing, the manhunt of the Tsarnaev brothers, and the capture of both brothers were posted continuously throughout the entire duration of the event. Information about the Boston Bombing countered the official narrative that the mainstream media had released which caused a split between what people were finding out through their friends on social media sites, and the official narrative of the mainstream media. Million of posts making speculations were made by amateur sleuths trying to help solve the ongoing investigation by uploading and re-posting new information through their personal social media accounts.Almost instantaneously everyone, with a cellphone or computer,  in the surrounding areas of Boston became a citizen journalist. Many news stations, and Authorities claimed that this interfered with the investigation and manhunt. 
             </p>

      

              <p class="quote">“Social media has been a vital resource this week is locating the Boston Marathon suspects. However, with such a huge flow of information, there can be negative repercussions, and misinformation runs rampant.”
               <br/> <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-medias-role-in-boston-bombing-investigation/">Link to Article</a></p>


                <p>This is now an example from history on how posting incorrect, biased, or harmful information to the web can end up having a disastrous effect. Police looking for possible leads in the investigation could have been lead in the wrong direction if they chose to follow inaccurate information posted by citizens on social media. 
                </p>

              <p class="quote">“We can’t objectively say a tweet is true or untrue, but we can say, ‘This tweet is being challenged somewhere, why don’t you research it and then you can hit the retweet button if you still think it’s true,’” Maddock said. “It wouldn’t necessarily affect that initial spike of misinformation, but ideally it would get rid of the persisting quality that misinformation seems to have where it keeps going after people try to correct it.” <br/><a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/03/17/hold-that-rt-much-misinformation-tweeted-after-2013-boston-marathon-bombing/">Link to Article</a></p>

              <p>
              In the aftermath, including the manhunt for the Tsarnaev brothers, a lot of misinformation was being posted around the web in regards to the investigation of the Boston Bombing. Twitter and Reddit received most of the credit for being the social media  platforms responsible for most of the misinformation that spread during the Boston Bombing. 
              </p>


              <p class="quote">“For example, they analyzed the rumor that an 8-year-old girl had died in the bombings. The researchers first identified tweets containing the words “girl” and “running,” then whittled that down to roughly 92,700 that were related to the rumor. They then found that about 90,700 of these tweets were spreading misinformation, while only about 2,000 were corrections. While the Twitter community offered corrections within the same hour the rumor appeared, the misinformation still persisted long after correction tweets had faded away.” <br/><a href=
              "http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/03/17/hold-that-rt-much-misinformation-tweeted-after-2013-boston-marathon-bombing/">Link to Article</a></p>
              <p> Posting rumors and false information are both examples of bad Digital Communication &  improper Digital Etiquette. Anyone with a computer or smartphone who is somewhat digitally literate can contribute to the ongoing story by simply posting new content to their favorite social media site. The only problem with this newly found ability, where citizens have the ability to subject new information, is lack of standards for what content is posted.  </p>

              <p>
              The Boston Bombing, despite being a national tragedy, also marked a historical moment, and  is one of the very first events, in our recent history, that the people had almost as much control over the official narrative broadcasted by traditional media sources. Reports from the Watertown, the town where the alleged suspects fled and where the manhunt for the suspects took place, were actively reported by citizen journalists the events during the search.
              </p>


              <p class="quote">“On Reddit, an increasingly influential social media site owned by magazine publisher Conde Nast, users posted pictures taken from the bomb scene and engaged in a large-scale, semi-organized effort to identify the bombers. At one point, users even compiled a spreadsheet of possible suspects, whom they sought to identify.” <br/><a href=
              "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/boston-marathon-bombings-how-twitter-and-reddit-got-it-wrong-8581167.html">Link to Article</a></p>
              <p>  Images of Armored personnel carriers, images of bullet stuck houses & cars, videos of a shootout with police, and much more were reported by citizen journalists in boston. Digital access also played a major role in bringing new information on the catastrophe into the public light as soon as it was reported. Millions of americans read, viewed, posted, and reposted information on the web as soon as the information was made available. Boston residents posted pictures from cellphone cameras, boston shop owners posted store video surveillance cameras, and people were re-posting mainstream media reports from the scene of the marathon throughout the entire crisis. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="conclusion">

              <p>The Boston Bombing was truly a tragedy that will not soon be forgotten, and was a sad moment in our nation’s history. There was silver lining to this tragedy which brought forth powerful evidence outlining the true importance of the internet, and other  technology that is available to us today.  have the traditional media to rely on for information, but we, as citizen journalists, have the power to share information amongst ourselves at lightening speed. It is up to us follow the guidelines of being a good digital citizen, and make sure that the information we are sharing is quality information that will benefit all those who download it. We as digital citizens have to hold ourselves to higher standard when posting information to the web. Making sure that the information that we post is Lawful, informative, and accurate.  </p>
